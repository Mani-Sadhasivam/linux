Actions Semi Owl SoCs Reset Management Unit (RMU)
=================================================

Please also refer to reset.txt in this directory for common reset
controller binding usage.

The RMU registers are part of the system-controller block on Owl SoCs.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "actions,s900-rmu"
- #reset-cells: Should be 1

All available resets are defined as preprocessor macros in corresponding
dt-bindings/reset/actions,s900-rmu.h header and can be used in device
tree sources.

Parent node should have the following properties :
- compatible: "syscon", "simple-mfd"
- reg: physical base address of the system controller and length of
  memory mapped region.

Example:

        sysctrl: system-controller@e0160000 {
                compatible = "syscon", "simple-mfd";
                reg = <0x0 0xe0160000 0x0 0x1000>;

                rmu: reset-controller {
                        compatible = "actions,s900-rmu";
                        #reset-cells = <1>;
                };
        };
