* Actions s900 Clock Controller

The Actions s900 clock controller generates and supplies clock to various
controllers within the SoC. The clock binding described here is applicable to
s900 SoC.

Required Properties:

- compatible: should be "actions,s900-clock"
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- #clock-cells: should be 1.

Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes can use this identifier
to specify the clock which they consume.

All available clocks are defined as preprocessor macros in
dt-bindings/clock/actions,s900-clock.h header and can be used in device
tree sources.

External clocks:

The hosc clock used as input for the plls is generated outside the SoC. It is
expected that it is defined using standard clock bindings as "hosc".

Actions s900 Clock Controller also require two more clocks:
 - "losc" - internal low frequency oscillator
 - "diff_24M" - internal differential 24MHz clock

Example: Clock controller node:

        clock: clock-controller@e0160000 {
		compatible = "actions,s900-clock";
		reg = <0 0xe0160000 0 0x1000>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};

Example: UART controller node that consumes clock generated by the clock
controller:

	serial5: uart@e012a000 {
		compatible = "actions,s900-uart", "actions,owl-uart";
		reg = <0x0 0xe012a000 0x0 0x2000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 34 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&clock CLK_UART5>;
		clock-names = "uart";
	};
